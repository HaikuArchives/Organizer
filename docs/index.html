<h2>Documentation  for fishingSubmarine Organizer</h2>
<br><br>
I'll bet you were thinking: "Wow, with such a great program, the documentation is probably huge!"
<br>
Well think again, documentation is for loosers with to much spare-time and people who dont have the
<br>
guts to dare to try the program without "breaking it", dont worry!; i have disabled the break function:-D
<br>
And is my program really THAT big and hard to understand that it needs documetation? I've got better
<br>
things to do in my spare time:-D
<br><br>
If you still feel that you need help or you want to contact for some other reason (bugreports and such)
<br>
(Or maybe you want to write a decent documentation for me?)
<br>
Dont hessitate(spelling?) to contant be at: <a href="mailto:m_stene@yahoo.com"><em>m_stene@yahoo.com</em></a> , wont bite hard.....
<br>
If you do decide to email me, i prefer to be refered to as Sir or King, not "You"!!!
<br><br>
Mariux is currently available on the market
<br>
So if you want to order a Mariux, send a mail to <a href="mailto:m_stene@yahoo.com"><em>me</em></a> and i will send my newest catalog were you can have a closer look at the goods
<br>
The subject of the mail should be "I want a Mariux", and be sure to tell me if you want the catalog with the Mariux-Porn or not...
<br>
Mariux comes with good self-documentation and a goodlooking body:-D
