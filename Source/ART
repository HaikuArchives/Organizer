Plans for rewritten Calender-Class

Each date should have its own "object thing"

Example: 

Class : CalenderDate
{
public:
BRect		fBounds;
BString		fDayName;
int			fDayNumber;
int			fMonthNumber;
int			fYearNumber;
};

1january = new CalenderDate;
1january.fBounds = (35, 35, 70, 70)
1january.fDayName.SetTo("Monday");
1january.fDayNumber = 1;
1january.fMonthNumber = 1;
1january.fYearNumber = 1337;
